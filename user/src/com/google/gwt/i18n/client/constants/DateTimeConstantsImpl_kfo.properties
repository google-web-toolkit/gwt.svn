# Following code is generated from CLDR data by script. You can do
# emergency fix here, but you fix will be lost unless it is also

# will be manually checked before check in to make sure undesired
# changes in CLDR will not break existing applications as possible.

# CLDR version 1.7.1 is used in this generation.
